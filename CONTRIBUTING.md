# Contributing to NovaHost

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NovaHost (formerly LightHostFork)! This document outlines the current development roadmap, prioritized tasks, and guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Development Roadmap

The following tasks are organized by priority to help focus development efforts on the most critical improvements.

### ðŸ”´ High Priority Tasks

#### Memory Management

- [ ] Replace all `ScopedPointer` usages with `std::unique_ptr` or JUCE's `UniquePtr`
- [ ] Review and fix potential memory leaks in plugin instance handling
- [ ] Audit resource cleanup in `PluginWindow` class destructors
- [ ] Implement RAII patterns consistently throughout the codebase
- [ ] Add smart pointer usage guidelines to documentation

#### Thread Safety

- [ ] Ensure UI operations run only on the message thread (use `MessageManager::callAsync`)
- [ ] Add thread safety for plugin scanning process
- [ ] Fix race condition in plugin timeout detection
- [ ] Add thread identification logging in debug mode
- [ ] Implement thread-safe access to shared resources

#### Error Handling

- [ ] Implement consistent error reporting mechanism
- [ ] Add user-facing error notifications for plugin failures
- [ ] Create error logging system for debugging issues
- [ ] Handle exceptions consistently across the codebase
- [ ] Add error recovery strategies for plugin crashes

### ðŸŸ  Medium Priority Tasks

#### Code Organization

- [ ] Remove duplicated code in `PluginWindow.cpp`
- [ ] Extract repeated declarations of `ProcessorProgramPropertyComp` class
- [ ] Consolidate redundant method implementations (`refresh()`, `audioProcessorChanged()`, etc.)
- [ ] Create proper utility classes for commonly used functions
- [ ] Move XML configuration data out of source code files
- [ ] Organize source files according to PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md structure

#### Coding Style Consistency

- [ ] Standardize on tabs vs spaces throughout the codebase
- [ ] Implement consistent bracing style
- [ ] Standardize naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes
- [ ] Add comprehensive code documentation
- [ ] Create style guide document for future contributors

### ðŸŸ¡ Lower Priority Tasks

#### C++ Modernization

- [ ] Leverage more C++17 features (structured bindings, std::optional, etc.)
- [ ] Update to newer JUCE APIs and patterns
- [ ] Replace legacy code patterns with modern equivalents
- [ ] Implement JUCE best practices throughout
- [ ] Evaluate C++20 features for possible adoption

#### User Experience Improvements

- [ ] Enhance plugin scanning progress reporting
- [ ] Improve multi-instance handling logic
- [ ] Add additional plugin categorization options
- [ ] Create more detailed audio device configuration options
- [ ] Implement customizable UI themes

#### Documentation

- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Add developer setup guide with environment configuration steps
- [ ] Document plugin compatibility considerations
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Create user manual with screenshots and usage examples

## Contributing Guidelines
