## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- [JUCE Framework](https://juce.com/) (automatically included as a local copy)
- C++ development environment:
  - Windows: Visual Studio 2019/2022 (with C++ Desktop Development workload)
  - macOS: Xcode 12+ with Command Line Tools
  - Linux: GCC 9+ or Clang 10+, CodeBlocks or Make

### Compilation Steps

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/blockie710/NovaHost.git`
2. Open the `NovaHost.jucer` file with Projucer
3. Select your target platform and export the project
4. Build using your platform's development environment

#### Windows-Specific Instructions
For detailed instructions on building and installing on Windows, see [Windows Installation Guide](docs/WINDOWS_INSTALL_GUIDE.md).

#### macOS and Linux
Additional platform-specific build instructions can be found in the documentation folder.

## Testing

### Running Tests

1. Open the solution in your development environment
2. Select the "Testing" configuration from the configuration dropdown
3. Build and run the solution to execute all unit tests

### Writing Tests

Tests are located in the `Tests/` directory and use JUCE's built-in unit testing framework. To add new tests:

1. Create a new test class by extending `UnitTest`
2. Implement the `runTest()` method with your test cases
3. Register your test class using a static instance

Example:
```cpp
class MyNewTests : public UnitTest
{
public:
    MyNewTests() : UnitTest("My New Test Suite") {}
    
    void runTest() override
    {
        beginTest("Test Case Description");
        expect(myCondition, "Expected condition description");
    }
};

static MyNewTests myNewTests;
```

## Command Line Options

- `-multi-instance=NAME`: Run multiple instances with separate settings, where NAME is a unique identifier
- `-plugins=PATH`: Specify a custom plugins folder path
- `-settings=PATH`: Specify a custom settings file path
- `-debug`: Enable additional debug output
